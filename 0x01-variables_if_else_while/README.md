1. This code runs a program that will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

2. This code runs a program that will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

3. This code runs a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

   *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
   *All your code should be in the main function
   *You can only use putchar twice in your code

4. This code prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in UPPERCASE, followed by a new line.
   *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
   *All your code should be in the main function
   *You can only use putchar three times in your code

5. This code prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.
   *Print all the letters except q and e
   *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
   *All your code should be in the main function
   *You can only use putchar twice in your code

6. This code runs a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

   *All your code should be in the main function

7. This code runs a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

   *You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
   *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
   *You can only use putchar twice in your code
   *All your code should be in the main function

8. This code runs a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

   *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
   *All your code should be in the main function
   *You can only use putchar twice in your code

9. This code runs a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

   *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
   *All your code should be in the main function
   *You can only use putchar three times in your code

10. This code runs a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

    *Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    *Numbers should be printed in ascending order
    *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
    *All your code should be in the main function
    *You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
    *You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

11. This code runs a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

    *Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    *The two digits must be different
    *01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
    *Print only the smallest combination of two digits
    *Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
    *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
    *You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
    *You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
     *All your code should be in the main function

12. This code runs a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

    *Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    *The three digits must be different
    *012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
    *Print only the smallest combination of three digits
    *Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
    *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
    *You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code
    *You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
    *All your code should be in the main function
